# SMITE

SMITE **(Society for Micronational Interbank Transactions and Exchanges)** is a discord bot that makes foreign exchange for micro nations possible as well as transferring funds to others.

The previous version of SMITE is `version 1` and it is programmed using Python. Problem is that a lot of users reported that SMITE-v1 performance is slow. 
I have to think about whether to go with Java, C++ or Rust. The most leading candidate is Rust because of its performance and memory safety so I chose it.
I abandoned slash commands due to the fact that it is very painful for me to implement it properly, users that always complain why the slash commands
doesn't work on their device or there are weird unknown glitches and bugs that I cannot explain and discord takes time to "register" my slash commands.
So maybe I will add slash commands support for later.

Keep in mind that this is still the **centralized**. I made this because SMITE-v1 is quite slow, I just want it to make it more efficient robust in the long run.
Although I have plans on making SMITE-v2 which is decentralized or federated.

- **SMITE-v1** - First version of SMITE, written in python.
- **SMITE-v1.1** - Complete rewrite of SMITE in Rust, made the commands more simpler (I hope).
- **SMITE-v2** - A decentralized/federated version of SMITE [STILL PLANNING]

I made v1.1 since it will take me a very long time to develop a solution that makes SMITE-v2 decentralized since security is a must for these kinds of systems.
